Description: The crio package helps R package developers implement
    stream-based filtering of large un-indexed data files.  Without
    crio, a typical workflow involves reading data into R, possibly in
    batches, and performing filtering operations at the R level.  In
    some cases, the overhead of reading the data into R can be
    substantial.  The crio framework provides a means of executing
    filters written in C before data is brought into R.  An example of
    how crio can be used is provided in a demo package 'criodemo'
    available in the tests subdirectory of crio's source package.
