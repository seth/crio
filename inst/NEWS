Version 0.0.4

- New external pointer based API.  This allows crio stream and filter
  objects to be easily wrapped in R external pointer objects.
  Finalizers are registered by the API to ease memory management.  The
  new API has the suffice *_xp.  To use it, include "crio_xp.h" in
  your code.

- Crio now has its own simple abstract syntax tree made up of CrioNode
  and CrioList.  Crio can evaluate these simple trees and convert R
  expressions into the crio native AST.  This will allow users to
  specify logical combinations of filters.

- Added a simple memory pool to manage crio list and node allocation.

- crio logic functions 'and' and 'or' now evaluate arguments in the
  expected order, handle errors in filters, and have short-circuit
  logic.  With this change is the assumption that all crio funs
  evaluate their arguments if needed.

- crio now supports a logical 'not' operator "!".

Version 0.0.3

- crio_set_errmsg now provides an sprintf-style interface

- Some refinement to code generation

Version 0.0.2
