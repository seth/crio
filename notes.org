* crio development notes

Package code contains a fixed set of possibly parameterized filter
functions f_1, f_2, ..., f_n.  In preparing for a call to read data
via a crio stream, the package will create crio filter structs wrapped
in external pointers using =crio_make_filter_xp=.  The
=crio_make_filter_xp= takes a name, a filter function pointer (f_k), a
filter context pointer (encapsulates the parameterization of f_k, and
a finalizer function pointer that can be used to free the filter
context.  The return value is an R external pointer SEXP wiht tag set
to the name value and pointer set to a newly allocated crio filter.
This external pointer will also have a finalizer registered for it
that will free the crio filter structure and the filter context data
(using the provided finalizer).

Package code will then
